# ![saxophone](Images/Saxophone_64.png) Birdland Musician's Assistant

Birdland is a Linux-based multimedia music viewer and library manager for music books in PDF form including fakebooks.  It
displays a page of music or a ChordPro song by searching a database of
titles and other metadata.  Answering the *Let's hear how it goes* query it also suggests
audio files, midi files, JJazzLab songs and YouTube links matching the search.

A secondary feature of Birdland is index management.  Birdland contains tools to quickly create
indexes using OCR, harmonize indexes from disparate sources, compare them, and integrate them into
one database.  Birdland ships with index data from 9 sources covering over 100 books
and over 20,000 titles.  Users can edit existing indexes and add their own.
